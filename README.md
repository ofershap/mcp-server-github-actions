Manage GitHub Actions workflows from your AI assistant. List runs, read logs, re-run failed jobs, cancel builds, and trigger deployments without leaving your editor.

```bash
npx mcp-server-github-actions
```

> Works with Claude Desktop, Cursor, VS Code Copilot, and any MCP client. Requires a GitHub token with Actions permissions.

## Why

GitHub's official MCP server covers repos, issues, and PRs, but it doesn't touch Actions. That means when your CI fails, you still have to open a browser, find the run, click through to the logs, and figure out what went wrong. This server fills that gap. You can ask your assistant "why did the last CI run fail?" or "re-run the failed jobs" and get answers right where you're working. It uses the same GitHub REST API you'd use manually, just without the context switching.

## Hosted deployment

A hosted deployment is available on [Fronteir AI](https://fronteir.ai/mcp/ofershap-mcp-server-github-actions).

## Quick Start

### Cursor

Add to your Cursor MCP settings (e.g. `~/.cursor/mcp.json` or project-level):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "github-actions": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "mcp-server-github-actions"],
      "env": {
        "GITHUB_TOKEN": "<your-token>"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Claude Desktop

Add to `claude_desktop_config.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "github-actions": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "mcp-server-github-actions"],
      "env": {
        "GITHUB_TOKEN": "<your-token>"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### VS Code

Configure your MCP client to run:

```bash
npx mcp-server-github-actions
```

Make sure `GITHUB_TOKEN` is set in the environment (e.g. in your shell profile or client config).

## Auth

Create a GitHub Personal Access Token:

1. **Settings** > **Developer settings** > **Personal access tokens**
2. Choose **Fine-grained tokens** (recommended) or **Tokens (classic)**
3. Fine-grained: select your repos, then enable **Actions: Read and Write**
4. Classic: enable the `repo` scope (includes Actions)

## Example Prompts

- "List the last 5 workflow runs for ofershap/mcp-server-docker"
- "Show me the workflows in the microsoft/vscode repo"
- "Get details for run 12345 in owner/repo"
- "Re-run the failed jobs for run 67890 in my-org/my-repo"
- "Cancel the currently running workflow run 11111"
- "List artifacts from the latest run in owner/repo"
- "Trigger the deploy.yml workflow on the staging branch for my-org/my-app"
- "What's the status of the most recent CI run for this project?"

## Development

```bash
npm install
npm run typecheck
npm run build
npm test
npm run lint
npm run format
```
